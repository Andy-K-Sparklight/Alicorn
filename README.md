That launcher of the block game, once with the magic of friendship.

## Our Goal

The development of Alicorn is based on the following vision:

- **Game First**

  Craft your game experience and click to play. Leave the technical jobs to us.

- **Free as in Pricing**

  You're paying for playing, no more for launching.[^1]

- **Free as in Freedom**

  Things related to your game really shouldn't be touched by something you can't control.

- **Cross Platform**

  Play on any computer regardless of its OS.[^2]

- **Fast**

  Spend time in your world, not entering your world.

- **Space Utilization**

  Create hundreds of game experiences while storing only one copy of game assets.

- **Not Opinionated**

  Play the game in the way you like. It's never a crime to fly in your own world.[^3]

- **Privacy Aware**

  We collect no data for analysis. There's no option to enable it.

## Supported Platforms

> [!NOTE]
> Platforms that do not have corresponding LWJGL artifacts are unsupported.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Certain game experiences may not be available on platforms that Alicorn runs on.

Systems:

- Microsoft Windows 10 / 11
- Apple macOS (Big Sur or later)
- GNU/Linux
    - There are no detailed compatibility metrics, but recent releases should work.

Architectures:

- `x64` (`amd64`)
- `arm64` (`aarch64`)

## Build

> [!NOTE]
> **You may not need to build Alicorn yourself.**
> For production usages, use stable releases can help to avoid potential bugs and pitfalls.
> To access the latest features, update from the beta channel to get tested builds.
> Only build from source for development.

Alicorn can be built from any platform it runs on. The following tools are required:

- Node.js >= 22 (LTS)

  The Node.js version for building will not affect the copy bundled with Electron.

- Git

1. Get the code:

   ```shell
   git clone --filter=tree:0 https://github.com/Andy-K-Sparklight/Alicorn.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   corepack enable
   pnpm i
   ```

3. Build and run:

    - For production:

      ```shell
      pnpm prod
      pnpm start
      ```

    - For development:

      ```shell
      pnpm dev
      ```

      This command builds the main process modules and starts a development server (with HMR) for the renderer.
      Changes made to the renderer will be reflected immediately once saved.

Certain features can be toggled or adjusted during the build process. Check and edit `config.ts` for details.
